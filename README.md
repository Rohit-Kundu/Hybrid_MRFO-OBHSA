# Hybrid_MRFO-OBHSA

Hybrid Wrapper Algorithm combining Manta Ray Foraging Optimization and Opposition-Based Harmony Search. The final population generated by MRFO is used as the initial population in OBHSA.

`python main.py --csv_name "/path/to/csv/features.csv"`

Other available parameters are: `--csv_headers` whose default value `no` suggests that the csv file has no headers. Change to `yes` if your file has headers. `--generations` has the default value of `20` meaning each algorithm (OBHSA and MRFO) will run for 20 generations to generate the populations. `popSize` has the default value of `20`, i.e., the deafult size of population is 20.
